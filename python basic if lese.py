Practice Questions: len() Function, count() Function, if, else, and elif
    
Questions on len() Function

   1) Write a Python program to find the length of the string "Hello, World!" using the len() function.
   2) Given a list fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'], use the len() function to find how many items are in the list.
   3) Write a Python program to find the length of the tuple (10, 20, 30, 40, 50).
   4) Create a Python function that takes a string as input and returns whether its length is greater than 10.
   5) Given a nested list matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], use the len() function to find how many rows are in the matrix.
   6) Write a program to determine if a list has an odd or even number of elements using the len() function.

Questions on count() Function

   1) Write a Python program to count how many times the letter 'a' appears in the string "Banana".
   2) Given the list numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5], use the count() function to count the occurrences of the number 2.
   3) Create a Python function that takes a list and an item as input and returns how many times that item appears in the list.
   4) Write a program to count how many spaces are in the string "Python is fun to learn!".
   5) Using the count() function, count how many 'b's are in the string "bubblebee".
   6) Write a Python script to count the number of occurrences of the word 'the' in a given sentence.

Questions on if, else, and elif
   1) Write a program that takes a number as input and prints "Positive" if it’s greater than 0, "Negative" if it’s less than 0, and "Zero" if it’s 0.
   2) Write a Python script to check whether a given string starts with 'A' or not using an if statement.
   3) Create a Python program to determine if a year is a leap year. If divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or divisible by 400, print "Leap Year", otherwise print "Not a Leap Year".
   4) Write a program to check if a number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
   5) Given a list of ages, write a program that categorizes each age as "Child", "Teen", "Adult", or "Senior" using an elif ladder.

Write a Python program that takes a grade as input and prints:
    "Excellent" for grades 90 and above,
    "Good" for grades between 75 and 89,
    "Pass" for grades between 50 and 74,
    "Fail" for grades below 50.
   
Bonus: Combined Practice Questions
    1) Write a program that takes a string, counts the occurrences of the letter 'e', and checks if its length is greater than 10.
    2) Create a function that accepts a list of numbers and counts how many numbers are even and how many are odd, using count() and if conditions.
